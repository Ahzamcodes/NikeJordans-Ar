# NikeJordans-Ar
Created an Android AR (Augmented Reality) application within Unity, centered on marker based interaction with Nike shoe boxes. Upon scanning, the app seamlessly superimposes a dynamic 3D model of the shoe, empowering users to customize its color and explore it from various angles for an immersive experience.
